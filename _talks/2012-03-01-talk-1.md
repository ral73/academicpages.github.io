In this talk, I shared early stage findings from my doctoral research at an international conference. I proposed taking into account issues of information overflow and dynamism for traditional conceptualizations of pluralism via a case study. Using concepts such as the ‘networked public sphere’ (Benkler, 2006) and related methods (Benkler et al., 2013) for guidance, I mapped out actors, frames, and connections surrounding a single topic of coverage. This topic of coverage is one that deeply concerns the role of digital intermediaries and the free flow of information online. Questions I explored within the context of this case study included: 
Who is engaging in discussion? What is most visible to the discussion, in terms of both frames and actors? What are some
possible reasons why?
