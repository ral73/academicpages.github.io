Overview of nascent book project. Questions addressed included:
-  What have we learned about 'big tech', exportation/importation of legal frameworks, and continued colonial exploitation of parts of the Global Majority? How can studying things like 'meaning making' help reveal mechanisms/actors at work in this space?
- How can/should academics write about things like technology and media when there's a sense that they are changing so quickly? How can we productively avoid and/or harness hope/hype cycles?
