This conference presentation focused on how researchers can more critically and effectively use network methods. I reflectively reviewed certain findings from my doctoral research, showing where my own biases (and limitations of standard methods) limited my findings. The above network mappings evidence how more powerful, visible sources more oft used 'rights to information' framings; by contrast, framings such as the 'right to remember', which was particularly debated in Latin America, were relatively marginalized. (This conference presentation led to [a publication]('/publication/2020-07-22-paper-mapping') in the peer-reviewed New Media and Society.)
