The above map was made with the top 500 hashtags used by 137 different UK think tanks between March 2009 and January 2018. We colored each cluster, finding that they focused on specific issues via qualitative analysis of the tweets. This was one part of a larger project to explore how think tanks could be studied using digital methods; the genesis and initial presentation of this project was at a week-long data sprint at the University of Amsterdam's Digital Methods Winter School.
