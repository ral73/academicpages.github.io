'This report aims to map the field of initiatives involved in the verification of digital information. The impetus for this research was the ongoing development of The Whistle, a web application that aims to connect civilian witnesses who are digitally reporting human rights violations with human rights organisations that can help them pursue accountability. Based on the premise that verification can be a bottleneck for these organisations' use of civilian witness information as evidence, The Whistle aims to speed verification practices with an eye to increasing the variety and volume of civilian witness voices in human rights reporting.
