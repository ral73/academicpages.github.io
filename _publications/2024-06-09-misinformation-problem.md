excerpt: 'Misinformation is a complex and global problem of social and technical dimensions. It is a problem that is exacerbated and sought to be solved by using diverse technologies. It is also a problem that flourishes on platforms and can lead to partnerships with platform companies. These sociotechnical dimensions of misinformation as a problem involve different actors. Some actors create or contribute to the problem, while others perceive it as their problem to solve and work to address it. Identifying the problem of misinformation is at the heart of the issue of problem-solving in fact-checking, as different actors have interests in how problems are discursively presented. This article draws on an international interview study conducted throughout 2020–2022 with 46 fact-checking actors (21 fact-checkers, 14 journalists, and 11 newsroom managers). This article analyzes how these actors reflect on “misinformation problems,” and how these problems become “fact-checking problems” for the actors to work with and solve. Ultimately, the article argues that fact-checking must be approached as a sociotechnical and problem-solving-oriented practice. Doing so highlights specific obstacles in information distribution and platform affordances.'
