I was a postdoctoral fellow on the [Source Criticism and Mediated Disinformation (SCAM) team](https://uni.oslomet.no/scam/) between 2021 - 2023, and continue to collaborate with this group of scholars today. Funded primarily by a $1M grant from the Norwegian Research Council, research activitie included semi-structured interviews with platform representatives, fact-checkers, and journalists across the globe. This project has also entailed a detailed mapping and analysis of hundreds of technologies and tools used by fact-checkers. 

This project has so far produced [several articles, book chapters, and events](https://uni.oslomet.no/scam/dissemination/)--aimed at both scholars and practitioners. Outputs have focused on [disinformation in political campaigning](https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Handbook-of-Political-Campaigning/Lilleker-Jackson-Kalsnes-Mellado-Trevisan-Veneti/p/book/9781032356716?srsltid=AfmBOopthd3iEjhihtFY_q5Ho0yQTlOv3P5LQ38ptaoX1_og1_P2LAB-), [platform and fact-checker relations](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/19851), and [ethical dimensions of leaked platform data](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8NBx6CMAAAAJ&citation_for_view=8NBx6CMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC).

The group is currently working on a manuscript entitled  <i>The Anti- Disinformation Industry</i>, which explores interests, motivations, and agendas of actors involved in the business of countering contemporary disinformation, from fact checkers, journalists, and governments to platform and technology companies. It presents a vision of how the field should reckon with the inequalities and power imbalances in the ‘industry’—especially in the context of advances in artificial intelligence.
