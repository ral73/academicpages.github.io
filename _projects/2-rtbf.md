title: "Right to be Forgotten Research Stream"
excerpt: "<em>The Right to Be Forgotten Decade: Definitional Battles and Platform Power</em> is my first solo monograph. It operationalizes and historicizes platform power through a topical analysis, demonstrating how platform companies manipulated headlines and technical newsroom operations. This book is based on a significant mixed methods approach: it draws from an open web mapping and content analysis of over 800 sources and 5000 texts, collected and analyzed between 2015 and 2018. It also draws from in-depth interviews within newsrooms, activist circles, and platform councils across three continents.<br/><img src='/images/rtbf-mapping.png'> <br/> 
<i>This is a network rendering of the most visible sources for coverage of a controversial privacy concept in the 2010s.</i>"
