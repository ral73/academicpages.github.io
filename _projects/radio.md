title: "The Utah Media Ecosystem: Radio, Religion, and Rurality"
excerpt: "<em></em> My third and most recent research stream engages explicitly with understudied contemporary media environments—especially those characterized the ‘rightwing’, broadcast media, rural vs. urban divides, and religion. Thus, my current case study is the state of Utah. Informed by ongoing mapping of key influences, actors, and discourses in Utah media, current areas of focus include: a) journalistic functions of talk radio stations that also syndicate extremist content; b) the sociotechnical influences exerted by the majority religion (LDS or Mormon) on local and global media flows; and c) the stickiness of specific strains of disinformation (e.g., the blend of claims via local ‘trad wife’ influencers, multi-level marketing, and health disinformation).<br/><img src='/images/oil-carbon.png'>"
