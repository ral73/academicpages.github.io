This project, funded by a Horizon Europe grant (2024 - 2026) is both exploratory and explanative. 

Informed by ongoing mapping of key influences, actors, and discourses in Utah media, current areas of focus include: a) journalistic functions of talk radio stations that also syndicate extremist content; and b) the sociotechnical influences exerted by the majority religion (LDS or Mormon) on local and global media flows.
