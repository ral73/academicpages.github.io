title: "<em>Research Project</em> <br/>The Utah Media Ecosystem: Radio, Religion, and Rurality"
excerpt: "This research stream, currently funded by a Horizon Europe grant, engages explicitly with media environments deeply affected by religion, rurality, and radio. Currently, I am exploring the Utah media ecosystem as an insightful case study, mapping actors, networks, technologies, digital identities, and cultural/ideological influences.  <br/><br/><img src='/images/oil-carbon.jpeg'>
