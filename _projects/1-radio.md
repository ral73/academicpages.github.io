title: "The Utah Media Ecosystem: Radio, Religion, and Rurality (2022 - Present)"
excerpt: "This research stream engages explicitly with understudied media environments deeply affected by religion, rurality, and radio. Currently, I am exploring the Utah media ecosystem as an insightful case study, mapping actors, networks, technologies, digital identities, and cultural/ideological influences. Methods are mainly ethnographic, but include some network mapping and content analysis. <br/><br/><img src='/images/oil-carbon.jpeg'>
