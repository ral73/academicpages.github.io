I am a postdoctoral associate at [MIT's Comparative Media Studies department] (https://cmsw.mit.edu/), teaching and researching through 2023. I am also a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Journalism and Media @ Oslo Metropolitan University, and a Research Associate at Cambridge University's [Centre of Governance and Human Rights](https://www.cghr.polis.cam.ac.uk/).  At OsloMet (through July 2023) I am working with an [international, interdisciplinary](https://uni.oslomet.no/scam/) team to understand how newsrooms approach misinformation around elections, particularly the US elections.

My personal research agenda is currently focused on understudied media environments, with special focus on the rural, religion, and radio. Currently, I am researching on the Utah media ecosystem, mapping actors, networks, technologies, digital identities, and cultural influences.

I recently, successfully defended my PhD in Sociology at the [University of Cambridge](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/rebekah-larsen) (December 2020). <b>I research and publish about how information moves online--what influences knowledge creation and 'news' in the digital age. </b> I am passionate about understanding--and improving--real world connections between tech and social life, both as a practitioner and a researcher. I am keen to empathetically take into account different experiences and identities in understanding these connections.
