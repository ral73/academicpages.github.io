I am a postdoctoral associate at [MIT's Comparative Media Studies department](https://cmsw.mit.edu/), teaching and researching through August 2023. I am also a Research Associate at Cambridge University's [Centre of Governance and Human Rights](https://www.cghr.polis.cam.ac.uk/).  I just wrapped up a postdoc working with an [international, interdisciplinary](https://uni.oslomet.no/scam/) team to understand how newsrooms approach misinformation around elections, particularly in the US. I was recently awarded a major research grant through the [prestigious EU Marie Curie programme](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/news/marie-sklodowska-curie-actions-award-eu257-million-to-postdoctoral-fellows-in-2022), which I will take up at the University of Copenhagen in summer 2024. First, during the 2023 - 2024 academic year, I will be a fellow at two major New England universities (to be announced soon). I am very much looking forward to three years of research time!

My personal research agenda is currently focused on understudied media environments, with special focus on the rural, religion, and radio. Currently, I am researching the Utah media ecosystem, mapping actors, networks, technologies, digital identities, and cultural/ideological influences.

I recently, successfully defended my PhD in Sociology at the [University of Cambridge](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/rebekah-larsen) (approved March 2021; conferred Sept 2022). <b>I research and publish about how information moves online--what influences knowledge creation and 'news' in the digital age. </b> I am passionate about understanding--and improving--real world connections between tech and social life, both as a practitioner and a researcher. I am keen to empathetically take into account different experiences and identities in understanding these connections.
