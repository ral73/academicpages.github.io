I am an early career media sociologist with a PhD from Cambridge University. I am currently a [Marie Curie Fellow] (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101109725) at the University of Copenhagen in the Communications Department; I also maintain affiliations at the Berkman Klein Center (Harvard Law Schol) and the [Center for Governance and Human Rights](https://www.cghr.polis.cam.ac.uk/) (Cambridge). Previous institutions include MIT (Comparative Media Studies), Yale Law School (Information Society Project), Oslo Metropolitan University (Department of Journalism and New Media), and the University of Pennsylvania (Department of History and Sociology of Science).

Broadly, my work uncovers and analyses understudied media ecosystems, particularly those with insightful relations to the ‘traditional press’ and concepts of dis/misinformation. I pay special attention to sociotechnical change, reproduction of discourse, and power relations within these systems. My scholarly sites of inquiry range from conservative talk radio stations in rural Utah, to the new global network of fact checkers funded by social media platform content moderation contracts, to search engine manipulation of journalists and activists around a controversial 2010s privacy regulation. Informed by cultural studies, media sociology, and conjunctural analysis, I use a blend of ethnographic, textual, and network mapping methods. My work also engages in reflexive critique of digital media research methods.

<!--I am also an academic affiliate at the [Berkman Klein Center](https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2023-07/berkman-klein-center-announces-incoming-2023-2024-fellows) (Harvard University). -->

My second main project focuses on media environments deeply affected by religion, rurality, and radio. Currently, I am exploring the Utah media ecosystem as an insightful case study, mapping actors, networks, technologies, digital identities, and cultural/ideological influences.
