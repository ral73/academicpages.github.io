I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Copenhagen, where I hold a major research grant through the [prestigious EU Marie Curie programme](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101109725). I am also an academic affiliate at the [Berkman Klein Center](https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2023-07/berkman-klein-center-announces-incoming-2023-2024-fellows) (Harvard University). I am also a Research Associate at Cambridge University's [Centre of Governance and Human Rights](https://www.cghr.polis.cam.ac.uk/).  I was previously a Visiting Fellow at the [Information Society Project](https://law.yale.edu/isp) (Yale Law School) and a Lecturer at MIT's [Comparative Media Studies department](https://cmsw.mit.edu/). I also work with an [international, interdisciplinary](https://uni.oslomet.no/scam/) team to understand how newsrooms approach misinformation around elections, particularly in the US.  
<br />
I hold a PhD in Sociology from the [University of Cambridge](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/rebekah-larsen). I also hold an MPhil in Technology Policy (Judge Business School, University of Cambridge) and a BA in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) from the University of Pennsylvania. 
<br /><br />I research and publish about how information moves online--what influences knowledge creation and 'news' in the digital age. I am passionate about understanding--and improving--real world connections between tech and social life, both as a practitioner and a researcher. I am keen to empathetically take into account different experiences and identities in understanding these connections.

This image is from my doctoral research, which I am currently turning into a book that examines a sticky privacy concept, the Right to be Forgotten. in terms of how it was defined ten years ago by a panicked press...and the impacts we see today in platform power. </i>

My second main project focuses on media environments deeply affected by religion, rurality, and radio. Currently, I am researching the Utah media ecosystem, mapping actors, networks, technologies, digital identities, and cultural/ideological influences.
