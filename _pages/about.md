I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Journalism and Media @ Oslo Metropolitan University. I am working with an [international, interdisciplinary](https://uni.oslomet.no/scam/) team to understand how newsrooms approach misinformation around elections, particularly the US 2020 election. I recently, successfully defended my PhD in Sociology at the [University of Cambridge](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/rebekah-larsen) (December 2020). <b>I research and publish about how information moves online--what influences knowledge creation and 'news' in the digital age. </b> I am passionate about understanding--and improving--real world connections between tech and social life, both as a practitioner and a researcher. I am keen to empathetically take into account different experiences and identities in understanding these connections.
