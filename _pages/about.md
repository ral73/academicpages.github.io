I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at the [University of Cambridge](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/rebekah-larsen). I submitted my dissertation in August 2020, and I am currently awaiting my defense. 

<b>I am passionate about understanding--and improving--real world connections between tech and social life, both as a practitioner and a researcher.</b> I am excited about bettering platform designs by empathetically taking into account the experiences of different users and identities. I also research and publish about how information moves online--what influences knowledge creation and 'news' in the digital age.
